    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Banana peels (from ripe but firm bananas)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari</li>
            <li>1tablespoon maple syrup or brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon liquid smoke (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>Pinch of black pepper</li>
            <li>Cooking oil (for brushing)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Prepare the banana peels: Peel ripe but firm bananas and carefully remove the inner fruit, leaving the peel intact. You can use the banana fruit for another recipe or enjoy it separately.</li>

            <li>Marinate the peels: In a shallow dish, mix together soy sauce, maple syrup or brown sugar, liquid smoke (if using), smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper. Place the banana peels in the marinade, ensuring they are coated evenly. Let them marinate for at least 30 minutes to absorb the flavors.</li>
        
            <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it with cooking oil.</li>
        
            <li>Arrange the peels on the baking sheet: Remove the banana peels from the marinade and shake off any excess liquid. Arrange them in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        
            <li> Brush the banana peels lightly with cooking oil. Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through, or until the edges are crispy and the peels are golden brown.</li>
        
            <li>Serve: Once the banana peel bacon strips are cooked to your desired crispiness, remove them from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving. Enjoy them as a crispy and savory snack or use them as a topping for salads, sandwiches, or any dish where you'd use traditional bacon!</li>
        
        <li>Feel free to adjust the seasonings according to your taste preferences, and enjoy your banana peel bacon strips!</li>
